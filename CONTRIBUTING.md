## Dependency Graph

Refer to the [dependency graph](docs/dependencies.md) for a visual representation of the project structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ (will be installed via pyenv if not available)
- Dependencies in requirements.txt

### Development Setup

1. If you don't have contributor access, **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-operator.git
   ```

3. You can set up your Python environment in one of two ways:

   **Option 1:** Use the provided install command (recommended):

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   This will:

   - Install pyenv if not already installed
   - Install Python 3.12 via pyenv if not already installed
   - Make Python 3.12 available as `python3.12` in your PATH
   - Create a virtual environment using Python 3.12
   - Install all project dependencies

   **Option 2:** Step-by-step setup:

   ```bash
   # First, set up Python environment (installs pyenv and Python 3.12)
   make setup-python

   # Then, manually create a virtual environment and install dependencies
   # (python3.12 should now be available in your PATH)
   python3.12 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Development Workflow with Makefile

We provide a Makefile to simplify common development tasks. You can see all available commands by running:

```bash
make help
```

### Common Commands

- **Install Project** (sets up Python environment and installs dependencies):

  ```bash
  make install
  ```

- **Setup Python Environment** (installs pyenv and Python 3.12 if needed):

  ```bash
  make setup-python
  ```

- **Start the Server**:

  ```bash
  make server
  ```

- **Start the Server with Hot Reload** (for development):

  ```bash
  make dev-server
  ```

- **Start the CLI**:

  ```bash
  make cli
  ```

- **Generate OpenAPI Specification**:

  ```bash
  make openapi
  ```

- **Run Tests**:

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

- **Generate Test Coverage Report**:

  ```bash
  make coverage
  ```

### Code Quality Commands

- **Format Code** (black and isort):

  ```bash
  make format
  ```

- **Run Linting** (flake8):

  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

- **Run Type Checking** (pyright):

  ```bash
  make type-check
  ```

- **Run Security Audit** (pip-audit):

  ```bash
  make security
  ```

Always run these quality checks before submitting a pull request. They will also be run in the CI pipeline on any branches with the `dev-` prefix and on PRs merged to `main`.

## Testing Guidelines

We use pytest for testing with async support:

- Keep tests in the tests/ directory
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage for new features
- Mark async tests with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`

## Contribution Workflow

Please follow the following steps to contribute:

1. For accounts without contributor access, create your fork of the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes with the `dev-` prefix

   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev-my-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b dev-issue-number-description
   ```

3. Commit changes with descriptive messages

   - Use the present tense
   - Keep commits small and atomic

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature for specific component"
   ```

4. Update documentation if adding new features or changing behavior

5. Push your changes to your fork

   ```bash
   git push origin dev-my-feature
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request against the main branch of the upstream repository

## Release Process

Once approved and merged, maintainers will package changes into releases with the following procedure:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Create a git tag with prefix `v` (for example `v0.2.0`)
3. Push the tag to the upstream repository on the commit to release on `main`
4. Create a release from the tag on GitHub with a concise release name and a description of the changes
5. CD will trigger on release creation and package and upload the version in `pyproject.toml` to PyPI

**For pre-release versions**:

- Use the `ax` or `bx` suffix (for example `v0.2.0a1`)
- Update the version in `pyproject.toml` on the `dev-` branch
- Releases can be created by maintainers from the `dev-` branch if they are not ready to be merged to main

## Pull Request Checklist

- Tests added/updated
- Documentation updated (README, docstrings)
- Code formatted with black and isort
- Linting passes (flake8)
- Type checking passes (pyright)
- All CI checks pass
- Security considerations addressed (for code execution features)

## Reporting Issues

When filing an issue, please include:

1. Local Operator version
2. Python version
3. Hosting platform (DeepSeek/Ollama/OpenAI)
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Expected vs actual behavior
6. Error logs (if applicable)

## Security Considerations

For features involving code execution or system operations:

- Clearly document security implications
- Maintain safety checks and user confirmations
- Add tests for potentially dangerous operations
- Follow principle of least privilege in file/system access

## Feature Requests

We welcome innovative ideas! When proposing new features:

- Explain the use case and target audience
- Outline potential implementation strategy
- Discuss security implications
- Suggest documentation needs

## Documentation

Help us improve documentation by:

- Fixing typos/outdated information
- Adding usage examples
- Updating the dependency graph in `docs/dependencies.md`
- Improving section organization
- Translating documentation (if applicable)

## Need Help?

Join our Discussions to:

- Ask questions about implementation
- Discuss architectural decisions
- Propose major changes before coding
- Share your use cases
