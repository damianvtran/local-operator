"""Check, merge and apply: the one orchestration every surface calls (design B5).

The runner, the desktop routes, the CLI and the ``agent`` tool all go through
:func:`check_items`, :func:`apply_items` and :func:`status_snapshot`; none of them
re-implements classification or wording. Everything here is SYNCHRONOUS and
blocking (registry files, ``requests`` clients, a model call in a worker loop),
so async callers reach it through ``asyncio.to_thread`` — the shape every desktop
route uses.

THE NEVER-BLINDLY-OVERWRITE ENFORCEMENT POINTS (B2.8), where they live here:
(1) the only write path takes a :class:`~local_operator.hub_sync.merge.MergeResult`
produced by ``merge_field``/``replace_field`` — there is no ``write(remote)``;
(2) proposals are validated inside ``merge_field``; (3) the apply re-verifies,
under the team registry's writer lock (agents: immediately before the write —
there is no agent registry lock, design Q4), that the row still equals the
snapshot the merge was computed from; (4) a backup of the local fields is written
BEFORE any change; (5) a large shrink forces ``needs-review`` under auto-update.

ONE WRITER AT A TIME, ACROSS PROCESSES. :func:`apply_items` takes the
:class:`~local_operator.hub_sync.store.RunnerLease` (heartbeat-renewed) for the
whole run unless it is a dry run, so the runner tick, the desktop routes, ``lop
agents|teams sync`` and the ``agent`` tool cannot compute and write the same item
concurrently (double model spend, double write). The daemon's routes additionally
serialise on the runner's ``asyncio.Lock`` (``HubSyncRunner.run_exclusive``) so a
button press queues behind a running tick instead of waiting out the lease. A
CHECK writes only ``status.json``, which has its own file lock; it does not take
the lease.

PARTIAL APPLY. Deliberately not done: an item is applied whole or not at all. The
design lets an agent's ``description`` apply while an ``instructions`` region is
unresolved; that needs per-field baselines and is listed as a follow-up rather
than half-built here. It is the conservative direction (nothing lands until a
human resolves the item).
