"""Input editor — TextArea inverted to chat semantics.

Textual's TextArea defaults to newline-on-Enter; this product wants
submit-on-Enter. The subclass inverts that and takes the terminal key idioms:

- ``Enter`` submits (posts :class:`EditorSubmitted`); with the command picker
  open it first completes the highlighted command, THEN submits
- ``Shift+Enter`` inserts a newline
- ``Ctrl+C`` posts :class:`InterruptRequested` (abort the turn) — never exits
- ``Ctrl+D`` on an EMPTY buffer quits; otherwise it falls through to delete
- ``Up``/``Down`` move the picker's highlight while it is open; otherwise they
  cycle prompt history when the caret sits at the top/bottom edge of the
  buffer, and inside the text they keep their cursor-move meaning
- ``Tab`` completes the highlighted command WITHOUT submitting
- ``Esc`` dismisses the picker, leaving the typed text alone

Key interception happens in :meth:`_on_key`, which runs BEFORE TextArea's
document-insert path, so a handled key never reaches the buffer. Unhandled
keys fall through to the stock editor behavior.

The caret is SOLID and never blinks, and on an EMPTY composer it gets a cell of
its own to the left of the placeholder rather than inverting the placeholder's
first letter; see ``cursor_blink`` in :meth:`__init__` and :meth:`render_line`.

The editor OWNS its :class:`CommandPicker` (built in ``__init__``, mounted by
the app as a sibling below the input row, since the picker must draw outside
the chevron+editor row). One picker always exists, so every completion path —
Tab, Enter, mouse click — runs through the same code with no "no picker
attached" variant to keep in step.

The picker under the field serves two lists. While the command WORD is open it
offers commands; once the word is terminated by a space, ``/model`` hands the
model picker its query and every command the registry marks as taking a value
(``SlashCommand.arguments``) puts the SAME command picker into argument mode
over that command's values — providers for ``/login``, modes for
``/approvals``, this model's rungs for ``/effort``. Which one is live is
decided by parsing the buffer (``slash_context`` versus ``slash_argument``), so
two lists can never be open at once.

Nothing here filters what may be SUBMITTED. The list ranks what is typed and
offers a completion; a user who knows the value types it and presses Enter, and
never sees the difference.

          have picked the row on the user's behalf, and an explicit move is the
          direct answer to that — the user read the list and chose. It is also the
          muscle memory every comparable picker (fzf, an editor command palette)
          has already taught: move, Enter, done;
        * the user typed the name in full, so they named it rather than letting
          the matcher choose; or
        * there is exactly one match, so the highlighted row is the only command
          the query could mean — EXCEPT on a destructive list, below.

        Everything else completes and waits for a second Enter. The point is the
        registry's uneven blast radius: `/usage` is harmless and `/loop` and
        `/logout` are not, so a fuzzy pick must not be *run* on one keystroke.

        "Exactly one match" is not evidence on a DESTRUCTIVE list, and that is the
        one place the distinction pays. The matcher is a subsequence matcher, so a
        query that spells nothing can still leave a single survivor: `/logout oer`
        reached openrouter, `/logout dpsk` deepseek and `/logout xoh` xai-oauth —
        each one Enter away from deleting a credential the user never named. A
        typo one letter off a real id lands in exactly this shape. So `/logout`
        asks for the id in full or an explicit move, and nothing else counts.
