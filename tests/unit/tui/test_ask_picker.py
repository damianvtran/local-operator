"""The ``ask`` picker: real keys and a real click, and what each one answers.

Driven with ``pilot.press`` rather than by calling the actions, because what is
being pinned is the KEYMAP as much as the state machine: the digits, Space, and
``j``/``k`` all change meaning on the free-text row, and a card that "worked"
while its bindings were unreachable would still be an unanswerable question.

The card's own arithmetic (widths, page size) is asserted through
``render_lines_for_test``; the layout it produces under the real stylesheet is
checked against ``OperatorApp`` at the bottom of the file, because the lightweight
host below declares no ``CSS_PATH`` and therefore cannot show a clip or a
scrollbar at all.
